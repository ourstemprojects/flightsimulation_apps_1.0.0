    "# PLAYER REGISTRATION\n",
    "---\n",
    "This app is the service used to run the player registration web UI for the Flight Simulation Game.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## DESIGN\n",
    "---\n",
    "The registration application itself is programmed in Python, with the `Flask` package serving the UI content.  Both the registration and response pages are coded in HTML/CSS with a little bit of Javascript.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the new player clicks `Register!`, the player's selections and avatar image are stored to the `avatardata` table of the MySQL database.\n",
    "\n",
    "The flow diagram below illustrates the program's design and logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "![registration design](./readme/flow_registration.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## START THE APP\n",
    "---\n",
    "Follow the steps below to start the registration interface:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Start the program by entering these commands into the CLI:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "> cd ~/<deployment_directory>/registration/\n",
    "> python app.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When the program starts, observe the host IP and port number <span style=\"background-color: black; color: yellow;\"> &nbsp; highlighted in yellow&nbsp; </span>, as these will be used in the browser to view the registration page.\n",
    "\n",
    "![startup screen](./readme/startup.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Open your internet browser - Firefox by design\n",
    "   + In the address bar, enter the IP and port number as observed in the step above\n",
    "\n",
    "3) <span style=\"color: #777;\">OPTIONAL:</span> run your browser in full-screen mode by pressing `F11`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## USE FROM A PORTABLE DEVICE (optional)\n",
    "---\n",
    "The registration app is designed to be run form a web browser on the local PC.  However with a couple config changes the app can be run from a portable device like a tablet or your phone!\n",
    "\n",
    "### CONFIG UPDATES\n",
    "Using `config.json`, update the following keys as shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "   + `site`: \"http://192.168.xxx.xxx:5000\"\n",
    "   + `host`: \"0.0.0.0\"\n",
    "   + `port`: 5000\n",
    "   \n",
    "The `site` key is used for file path string replacement when loading the player's avatar image into the database.  This key must be the **local IP of the PC running the app, and the port number being used.**  \n",
    "The `host` key is set to 0.0.0.0, making the site 'public'.  \n",
    "The `port` key is the port used, and **must match the port used in the `site` string.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### USE\n",
    "On your portable device, simply open a browser app and type the IP and port into the address bar.  For example: http://192.168.0.62:5000.  Done!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### TROUBLESHOOTING\n",
    "If the registration site does not load, it *might* be a firewall setting on the PC running the app.\n",
    "\n",
    "**LINUX**  \n",
    "If running the app on Linux, you can use the following command to punch a hole in the firewall to allow the portable device to access the app, and thus load the site.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "> iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport 5000 -j ACCEPT\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "   + `-I` stands for **insert**, which inserts a new rule at the top of the `iptables` chain.  `INPUT` tells `iptables` which chain you want the rule added to\n",
    "   + `-p tcp` tells the rule to match only packets using the TCP protocol\n",
    "   + `--dport 5000` says to match traffic headed for port 5000.  **This port must match the port used in the config file!**\n",
    "   + `-j ACCEPT` jumps to the ACCEPT action, to allow the traffic through"
