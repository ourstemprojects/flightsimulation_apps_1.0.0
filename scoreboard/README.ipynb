    "# SCOREBOARD\n",
    "---\n",
    "The scoreboard app serves the web interface which displays the player queue, 'flight' profile image and high-scores for the Flight Simulation Game.\n",
    "\n",
    "Included in the scoreboard display are:\n",
    "+ the name and avatar of the player who is currently playing the game\n",
    "+ a list of queued players waiting to play the game\n",
    "+ a top **$n$** list of high-scores\n",
    "+ a PNG image showing the game's target profile overlaid with the most recent player's cycled profile; allowing the player to see how they did\n",
    "\n",
    "The player's profile image is created by the `profiler` application and is stored in this program's directory structure, and can be made available to the player upon request.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## QUEUE MANAGEMENT CONTROLS\n",
    "---\n",
    "Queue management controls are built into the queue table, enabling a game administrator to:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ set a player's status to PLAYING\n",
    "+ move a queued player to the back of the queue\n",
    "+ remove a queued player from the queue\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setting a player's status\n",
    "This control is used to activeate a player on the bike and make them ready for game play.  To change a player's status from **QUEUED** to <span style=\"color: #00afd5;\"><b>PLAYING</b></span>, click the **QUEUED** label.  *Ideally* this will be the player at the top of the queue table.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Moving a player to the back of the queue\n",
    "If a player in the queue table is not available for play, they can be moved to the back of the queue so the next player can play the game. To move a player to the back of the queue list, click the player's name.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Remove a player from the queue\n",
    "If a player is no longer available, or no longer wants to participate, click the player's avatar image and click `YES` to the confirmation prompt to remove them from the queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** the player's record **is not deleted** from the database, but rather, their status is updated to DELETED.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## DESIGN\n",
    "---\n",
    "The scoreboard's back-end application is written in Python, using the `Flask` package to serve the UI content.  The front-end (UI) element of the scoreboard is written in HTML/CSS and a little bit of Javascript.\n",
    "\n",
    "The flow diagram below illustrates the program's design and logic.  \n",
    "\n",
    "![scoreboard design](./readme/flow_scoreboard.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## POST-DEPLOYMENT CUSTOMISATION\n",
    "---\n",
    "After deployment, you may want to customise the UI's appearance.  Here are a couple tips for replacing the banner and company logo:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Add your own banner and/or company logo to the `./static/images/` directory\n",
    "   + reference the banner image and/or company logo in the HTML file, located here: `./templates/scoreboard.html`\n",
    "      + the `<img>` tag will be near the top of the `<body>` element  \n",
    "   + adjust the logo's position using the `.img-logo` class in the CSS file located here: `./static/styles/styles.css`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## START THE APP\n",
    "---\n",
    "Follow the steps below to start the scoreboard:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Start the program by entering these commands into the CLI:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "> cd ~/<deployment_directory>/scoreboard/\n",
    "> python app.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When  the program starts, observe the host IP and port number <span style=\"background-color: black; color: yellow;\"> &nbsp; highlighted in yellow&nbsp; </span>, as these will be used in the browser to view the scoreboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "![startup screen](./readme/startup.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Open your internet browser - Firefox by design\n",
    "   + In the address bar, enter the IP and port number as observed in the step above\n",
    "\n",
    "3) <span style=\"color: #777;\">OPTIONAL:</span> run your browser in full-screen mode by pressing `F11`\n"
